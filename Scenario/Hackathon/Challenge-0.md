- A modern laptop running Windows 10, Mac OSX 10.12 or higher
- Preferably with at least 2 monitors

- Your preferred IDE (integrated development environment) for exploring the Contoso Video web app or data generator projects, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- [MS SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)
  > Note: Current screenshots show using **ODBC** to connect to SQL Server but the current recommendation is to use **OLE DB**. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/native-client/applications/installing-sql-server-native-client?view=sql-server-ver15

**If** you wish to run the web app or data generator locally **from the source**, you will need to install the following:
